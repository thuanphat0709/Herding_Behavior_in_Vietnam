## Abstract

This research examines the impact of information asymmetry on herding behavior among 
investors in the Vietnamese stock market. We investigate this relationship at three levels: aggregate 
market level, investor level, and firm level. First, at the aggregate market level, our evidence suggests 
that decrease of asymmetric information resulting from the issuance of a new regulation - Circular 
155/2015/TT-BTC can reduce the intensity of herding due to a decrease in non-information-based 
intentional herding and the losing popularity of momentum trading. Second, at the investor level, the 
study finds evidence of asymmetric herding between arbitrageurs and noise traders. Herding among 
arbitrageurs and noise traders is also found to significantly decrease following the issuance of the 
new regulation. Finally, at the firm level, herding intensity is higher between stocks with higher levels 
of information asymmetry, such as those with lower market capitalization, heavier tails in their return 
distribution, and higher idiosyncratic risk variance ratios.
